# Web-people-db
Spring MVC project that helps to work with a database of people.
Opportunities:
- You can add people to this list by filling out the form at the bottom of the page. The "Photo" field is optional if some people don`t have a photo you can just leave this field empty.
- Also you can delete one person or more at a time by selecting their row in the "Select" column.
- You can import a .csv file and it automatically adds all people from this file to the table.

This program uses two different storages. One for people entities and one for photo files. I created a pagination in this. Html was written by using Thymleaf.
